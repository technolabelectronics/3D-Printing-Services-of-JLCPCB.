# Diverse 3D Printing Technologies: Tailored Solutions for Every Need

JLCPCB boasts an extensive array of 3D printing technologies, catering to the diverse requirements of its clientele. The available 3D printing processes include:

1. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): Ideal for creating robust and functional parts using powdered thermoplastics. SLS is well-suited for applications where strength and durability are paramount.

2. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM): This widely adopted technology employs a thermoplastic filament to create parts. It is cost-effective and versatile, making it suitable for rapid prototyping and functional testing.

3. Stereolithography (SLA): SLA uses a laser to solidify liquid resin, layer by layer, resulting in highly detailed and accurate parts. It is an excellent choice for producing intricate and visually appealing prototypes.

4. Selective Laser Melting (SLM): SLM is an advanced 3D printing method that utilizes a high-powered laser to fuse metal powders together, enabling the creation of complex metal parts with excellent mechanical properties.

5. HP Multi Jet Fusion: This technology delivers exceptional speed and precision by using a binder and fusing agent to build up parts layer by layer. It is particularly suitable for functional prototypes and small-batch production.
